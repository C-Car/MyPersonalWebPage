        <p><b>Personal Background: </b>My name is Connor Carroll, I was born and raised in Charlotte, NC. I graduated from Hopewell High School in 2021 with hopes and dreams of becoming a Software Engineer. I have two dogs and one cat and they are really cute. I love conversing about technology and meeting new people!</p>
        <p><b>Professional Background: </b>I am a 2nd year Software Engineering Student at University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My experience constitutes only small personal projects, freelance development work, and course projects; some of which were individually completed and some were done as a team.</p>
        <p><b>Academic Background: </b>I graduated from Hopewell High School in 2021 with a 4.289 GPA and almost a completed associates degree in IT from Central Piedmont Community College. I started attending UNCC in fall of 2021 and will graduate with a bachelors in Computer Science-Software Engineering and a minor in Mathematics.</p>
        <p><b>Background in this Course: </b>None!</p>
        <p><b>Primary Computer Platform: </b>Dell XPS 15 with Windows 11 Pro</p>
        <p><b>Courses I am taking and why: </b></p>
        <ul class="text-start">
            <li>ITIS - 3135 Web Application Development [ 3 Credit Hours ]
                I am interested in the course material and its applications towards my career.
            </li>
            <li>
                ITSC - 3155 Software Engineering [ 3 Credit Hours ]
        I am interested in the course material and its applications towards my career, especially considering my concentration is Software Engineering
            </li>
            <li>
                ITSC - 3688 Computers & Their Impact on Society [ 3 Credit Hours ]
        I am interested in the reactionary elements of Computer Science. This will aid my ethical perspective on computing projects in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
                MATH - 2164 Matrices and Linear Algebra [ 3 Credit Hours ]
        Required Course. Still, however, I am interested in the course material and its applications to my major.</p>
		<p><b>Interesting Fact: </b>My favorite device/interface lacks a screen and keyboard, it lacks power and capability in regards to the daily usage of technology. A raspberry pi, though not nearly powerful enough to be used like a machine, is exemplary of my learning style and swiftness. It represents the enormous possibility and creativity that I have as a learner. Making circuits and code is without a doubt my favorite past time.

        </ul>
